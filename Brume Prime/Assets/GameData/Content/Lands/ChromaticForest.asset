  flavor: Gaining its namesake from the thousands upon thousands of butterflies that
    dance atop the canopy of its towering ancient trees. The myriad of colors against
    the lush green of the trees produces a dazzling display that heartens and transfixes
    all who see it. Those who venture in can also partake of the massive sweet fruits
    that hang low and heavy from the nearly every branch. The fruit is of great assistance
    to travelers as they make their way through the forest, as no game animals, or
    animals of any sort, have ever been seen within its boundaries.
