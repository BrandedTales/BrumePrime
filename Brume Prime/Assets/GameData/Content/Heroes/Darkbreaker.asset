  flavor: "Little is known about this enigmatic dwarf that arrived sitting silently
    upon a burnished silver throne. Rumors say that he was a King, other whispers
    declare him a usurper. His face gives no clue to these mysteries as it is always
    covered in a full helm and armor made of the same bejeweled silver as the throne
    he arrived on. All that can be seen of the being underneath is a long dark brown
    beard threaded with semiprecious stones. It has fast become habit for the few
    dwarves of this place to petition M\xF6tsognir for his aid in these dark lands.
    He listens to their plees upon his throne and, if task judged worthy, silently
    takes up his runic axe and seeks battle with the beasts that hunt his people. "
