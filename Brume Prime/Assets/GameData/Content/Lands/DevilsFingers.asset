  flavor: In the center of a vast, windswept, plane sits five irregular stone columns
    of enormous size, each reaching hundreds of feet towards the sky. Intricate circular
    patterns, whose artists have long been lost to memory, adorn every inch of the
    rising stone. It is local rumor that these pillars have subtly moved since their
    discovery but, upon investigation, this is likely more rumor than fact.
