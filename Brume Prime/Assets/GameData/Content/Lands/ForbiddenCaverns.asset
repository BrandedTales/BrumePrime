  flavor: Deep within an age worn mountain range rests the ancient remains of a monastery
    once dedicated to the God of Light. According to decaying sacred scrolls within,
    the purpose of this once holy place was to safeguard the entrance to the caves
    that run beneath the mountains.  What remains of the scraps of books that can
    be recovered describes caverns of impossible angles and rooms of steel guarded
    by creatures from nightmare. Tireless searches yield no signs of the caves described;
    merely mounds of rubble.
