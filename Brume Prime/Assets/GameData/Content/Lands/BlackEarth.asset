  flavor: The smell of dark earth hangs heavy over this pastoral landscape; its flattened
    fields boasting some of the richest soil ever encountered. Farmers from across
    the lands have flocked here to take advantage of the relative peace of the area
    and its plentiful harvests. Rumors of dark cults and blood sacrifice make the
    rounds whenever a family here goes missing, but are quickly forgotten as another
    bountiful season comes to a close.
