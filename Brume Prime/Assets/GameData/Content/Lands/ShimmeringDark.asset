  flavor: 'Shining forth from the rock face enormous veins of silver can be seen on
    nearly every wall of this mine. Glittering jewels gleam in the dark surrounding
    the ancient dwarven stone pillars that hold up the ceilings of the shafts, each
    shimmering like stars in the night sky as light hits precious stones. The gnawed
    bones of miners both ancient and new litter the caverns, all with bags and pockets
    stuffed and overflowing with jewels, their worn picks still clutched in their
    hands or embedded in the rocks they never stopped striking. Truly this is a place
    of wonder and riches; the urge to begin excavation immediately is uncomfortably
    powerful and only grows as each minute passes. '
